If I question what is life, life becomes a question. If I enjoy it, it becomes                     a gift. But thats illogical, in that case, life becomes a deep paradox, therefore, life is what we make                     it.

So, unless I dropped myself all over the places, I cannot be just my body. Am I my thought?         I'm forgetful, and If I forget few parts of me and still be myself, I am not my thoughts too.         I am the fourth. As in adwaita Vedanta, the fourth, the turiyum (तुरियम्).
